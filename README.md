# GOOSE – Gamified Open-sourced Opportunities for Spatial Education

**GOOSE** is a **paper-based co-design toolkit** for school teachers and educators to collaboratively create activities for **immersive, multisensory learning spaces**.  
The toolkit combines **playful exploration** and **structured templates** to guide participants from idea generation to complete activity plans.

Originally developed as part of [SENSEi](https://www.sensei.space/), GOOSE has been used in co-design workshops with dozens of educators to design activities that are **engaging, inclusive, and adaptable** to diverse classroom needs.

## What’s Inside

This repository contains all the **open-source** materials you need to run GOOSE co-design sessions, including:

- **Editable source files** (Adobe Illustrator `.ai` and Vector `.svg`) for:
  - Custom card decks (environment, stimuli, input modalities, etc.)
  - Large A3 activity maps (Map 1, Map 2, Map 3)
- **Print-ready PDFs** for immediate use
- **Facilitation guide** explaining:
  - Session setup and group size
  - Step-by-step activity flow
  - How to use cards and maps in each phase
- **Example activities** created in real workshops
- **Attribution guidelines** (how to credit the toolkit in research/public use)

## How It Works

1. **Playful Exploration**  
   Participants roll dice, draw cards, and explore possible environments, sensory outputs, and interaction modalities.

2. **Structured Ideation**  
   Using the A3 maps, groups combine selected cards to design an activity concept for the immersive room.

3. **Activity Detailing**  
   Each group fills in the final map with a detailed description, including objectives, dynamics, and inclusivity features.

## Who Is It For?

- **Educators** wanting to design immersive learning activities
- **Researchers** studying co-design and participatory methods
- **Facilitators** running workshops on inclusive education
- **Designers** adapting the toolkit to new contexts
